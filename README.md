Code Louisville Project for Front End Web Development 2017

This is my attempt at a basic resume website. I tried to incorporate color and responsive design into my website. I kept it very basic since I am just beginning to learn. I included a button which I used jquery to create at the very bottom of the page that would eventually lead to more information, but for now it is just a "coming soon" message.

On the advice of a mentor, to try to meet the requirement for responsive design I added a max-width media query to the css. When the screen size gets smaller you will see the .right div becomes 100% of the screen and the .left div gets hidden. I know this isn't a lot of responsiveness, but since there are some changes that happen on my page due to different devices and/or browser sizes it will meet the minimum requirements.

I learned a lot through the process. Thanks for reviewing!
